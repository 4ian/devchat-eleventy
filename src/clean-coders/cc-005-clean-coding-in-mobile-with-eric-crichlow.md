Eric transitions to talking about how IOS development has changed over the past 10 years. When a new operating system comes out, his go-to method for learning is to pick up a book. He reads the book cover to cover, but he only codes from the first third of it, which is the basic concepts. He finishes the show by talking about his series on Clean Coders and the importance of going out and meeting people for your career.
