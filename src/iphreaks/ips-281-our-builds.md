They discuss, Xcode, VScode and the Dash app. They move on to testing, explaining that they generally use what apple provides unless they need something that digs a little deeper. They discuss Fastlane as a deployment tool. Tools they use for crash reports include Sentry, Xcode, and Crashlytics.

For debugging the panel discusses Reveal, Sourcetree, SwiftLint, Charles proxy, and Pony debugger. Charles wonders what they prefer for their backend.
