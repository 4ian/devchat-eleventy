question1: What is a monorepo?
answer1: >-
  A single source code repository that has both an API and its client in the
  same repo or maybe multiple projects that work together but they are sort of
  distinct and run separately into different run times in the same repo.
question2: When does it make the most sense to use a monorepo?
answer2: >-
  With a new team and new project where they are still figuring out where
  everything goes. 
question3: How can using monorepos hurt the quality of your applications?
answer3: 'Constant deployment will constant interrupt the application for you clients. '
question4: Does the size of your team effect the usefulness of a monorepo?
answer4: 'Yes, monorepos work better for smaller teams. '

In this episode of Elixir Mix the panel discusses monorepos. They start by defining monorepos and sharing examples of what this looks like. The panelists share the pros and cons of working in a monorepo. They discuss the different projects they worked on using a monorepo and what their experience was like.

Monorepos allow for rapid development.  Any developer can pull it down and work on it. They work better for teams who are new with a new project and they are still trying to figure out where everything goes. In situations like these, quality is not a large concern but once quality is a priority monorepos make less sense.

On the other hand, monorepos make it easier for developers to forget that these applications are distinct. It also makes it easy for developers to ignore older versions of applications. The panel considers if monorepos are worth these downsides. The panel considers how monorepos work with Live View. They also discuss using an umbrella project similarly to monorepos.
