In this episode of React Native Radio the panel discusses the different approaches frameworks have for building stack. The panel takes a moment to define the two major approaches, libraries and batteries included. They list various frameworks and discuss where they lie on the scale of libraries to omakase.

Frameworks like React and React Native are the panels examples of a libraries approach framework. Developers pick and choose libraries to build their stack, React is basically just a UI library. They use Ruby on Rails as the example of an omakase approach; about 80% of the stack is chosen for you.

The pros and cons of each approach are considered. The panel shares their experiences picking libraries for their React and React Native apps and describe some of the challenges. Along with the freedom and flexibility given to the developer with a libraries approach, there is also the stress of keeping up with the latest libraries and tools. The beauty of this approach is the diversity and decentralization.

The omakase approach relieves the stress of keeping up with the latest libraries because it chooses them for you. There is safety in numbers, meaning the libraries chosen by omakase frameworks will always be supported. Also, substitutions are still possible. This approach can also be helpful for beginners, giving them training wheels and room to learn without too much responsibility.

The panel discusses when each approach is helpful. They share their experiences with each approach and with frameworks that lie somewhere on that spectrum. The panel shares their preferences. The needs for conventions and standards are considered. The panel shares options for an omakase approach for React.
