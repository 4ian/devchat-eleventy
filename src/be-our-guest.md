# Be Our Guest

If you'd like to be a guest on one of our podcasts, the process is pretty simple!

If you have a topic that you think would pay off for developers or devops engineers, email (team@devchat.tv)[mailto:team@devchat.tv] and let us know what you'd like to talk about.

Here are a few ideas about what make great topics:

* How you solved a specific problem with one of the the technologies we talk about on one of our podcasts. (e.g. JavaScript, Ruby, Elixir, Angular, Vue, React, React Native, .NET, DevOps, etc.)
* The specific problem solved by your product. (Shows about a commercial offering are a paid offering and are released as a bonus episode.) Shows about a specific problem and how that problem is solved without being a product pitch will be considered as a regular podcast episode release.
* Open source software your company has released for other developers to use.

Here are a few more concrete examples:

* At your company, you ran into a sticky problem setting up GraphQL in Rails and engineered an elegant (or not so elegant) workaround. Come talk to us about lessons learned.
* If you've vastly improved SEO on your website, come talk to us about how developers can achieve the same thing for their employers.
* If you're image resizing software or provide CI/CD pipelines or system security, come talk about the first steps developers can implement to do better with image resizing, CI/CD, or system security on their own.

If you're interested in being or referring a guest, email team@devchat.tv and explain what the show will be about and we'll evaluate your request and let you know how to get scheduled.
